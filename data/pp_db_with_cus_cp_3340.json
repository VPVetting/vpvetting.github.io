    "description": "SENTIO VR is the easiest way for presentation of architectural & interior design spaces in Virtual Reality. With SentioVR, users can create an account & share Virtual Reality experiences of designs using all types of architectural render formats (spherical, stereo spherical, cubemap, stereo cubemap). By uploading content on our web platform- produced from professional 3D software ( Sketchup, 3DS Max, Revit ) or professional 360 cameras, users can create & customise tours - which are transformed into shareable experiences ready to view on PC/Mobile & VR devices in a few clicks.\n\nNeed some inspiration ? Download the app & explore a unique gallery of 360 experiences of architectural sites curated by ArchDaily - the worldâ€™s most visited architecture website.\nDescription\nSENTIO VR is the preferred 3D visualization platform for professionals working in the Architecture, Engineering & Construction Industry in 100+ countries. How does a project that has not yet been built look like? Instead of reviewing 2D floorplans, renders & video walkthroughs - SENTIO VR customers put on an Oculus Quest headset for real-time feedback with clients, improved designs & win new projects.\nHere are the key features that make SENTIO VR stand out:\n\nPlugins for SketchUp & Autodesk Revit\n\n\nNo downloads or upload of files needed. Works with your existing design tools\n\n\nNo additional downloads\n\n\nNo additional PC software is required to manage the model upload process.\n\n\nIntuitive VR meetings\n\n\nMulti-user collaboration meetings have never been easier using access codes & passwords\n\nHave questions?
